Building Wespal
===============

These instructions apply to the source code only. If you are using the provided binary packages, you should be able to just run Wespal right away.


Dependencies
------------

You will need a basic development environment (e.g. GCC with the C++ compiler) as well as the Qt development files.

Wespal should build and run with Qt 5.11 and later, and GCC 8 and later. Slightly older versions may work as well but no support will be provided for them.

KDE Frameworks 5 is not required to build or run Wespal, but it may provide additional image format plugins to handle layered GIMP `.xcf` and Adobe Photoshop `.psd` files. If detected at runtime, Wespal will support these formats as well.


Building from source
--------------------

First you need to generate a Makefile:

```
$ cd wespal-X.Y.Z/
$ qmake -config release
```

Then you can build the application:

```
$ make
```

An executable file `wespal` will be generated in the current directory.


Installing
----------

For your convenience, the provided `install` target will install Wespal to `/usr/local/bin` and add an applications menu entry for you:

```
$ sudo make install
```

Or (as root):

```
# make install
```

If this does not suit your needs, you can copy the executable file generated in the previous step to a different location, such as `$HOME/bin`, or just keep it where it is â€” installation is *not* strictly necessary. However, you may want to manually create a desktop or applications menu launcher for easy access.
