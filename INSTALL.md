Building Wespal
===============

These instructions apply to the source code only. If you are using the provided binary packages, you should be able to just run Wespal right away following the instructions in `README.md`.


Dependencies
------------

 * CMake 3.21.1 or later
 * GCC 7 or later / Clang 5 or later / another C++17-compatible compiler
 * Qt 6.4 or later

KDE Frameworks is not required to build or run Wespal, but if installed and properly configured, the KImageFormats component provides additional image format plugins to handle GIMP (`.xcf`), Krita (`.kra`), OpenRaster (`.ora`) and Adobe Photoshop (`.psd`) files.

> [!TIP]
> If you are running Linux and have KDE Plasma or KDE applications installed you will probably already have KImageFormats installed as well.

Alternatively, Wespal can use its own stripped-down version of KImageFormats if configured by CMake with `-DENABLE_BUILTIN_IMAGE_PLUGINS=ON`. In order for this to work, you will need to have the zlib development files installed as well.


Building from source
--------------------

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are checking out the source code from Git and wish to use the internal version of KImageFormats, you **must** make sure all Git submodules are checked out first by using the following commands. Failure to do so **will** result in build-time errors.
> ```
> $ git submodule init
> $ git submodule update
> ```

After unpacking the source code you need to set up the CMake build directory:

```
$ cd wespal-X.Y.Z/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Then you can build the application as follows. Adding `-jN` to the command line (replacing N with the number of CPU cores available) can speed up compilation significantly by working on up to N files simultaneously:

```
$ make -j4
```

An executable file `wespal` will be generated in the build directory. You can either run Wespal straight from here, or follow the next step to install it system-wide to `/usr/local` or a custom location you may specify by passing `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/location/here` to CMake in step 1:

```
$ sudo make install
```

Installing Wespal system-wide has the added benefit of generating a desktop application menu entry for you, which also allows the application icon to be recognized on Wayland-based desktop environments.

If you choose instead to run Wespal from its build directory, you may want to grab a copy of the launcher in `desktop/me.irydacea.Wespal.desktop` and edit it to point to the Wespal binaryâ€™s actual location for easier access.


CMake options
-------------

The following options can be defined when configuring Wespal for building with CMake by specifying `-D<option>=<value>` in the command line (without the angle brackets):

### General options

* `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build type>`

  Selects the build type and optimization level, which is one of: `Debug` (default), `MinSizeRel`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`. Most people want to use `Release`.

* `ENABLE_BUILTIN_IMAGE_PLUGINS=ON`

  Enables an internal stripped-down version of KImageFormats to be built in order to support additional image formats. If you have KDE Frameworks 6 installed, it is highly recommended you leave this option disabled.

### Development/debug options

These options are only useful for hacking on Wespal and serve no purpose to most users other than increasing build times and reducing performance.

If you need to make use of them, you should also set `Debug` as your build type to allow debuggers and compiler instrumentation libraries to provide more detailed/accurate information.

* `ENABLE_TESTS=ON`

  Enables a test suite to be built for development purposes. This suite can be run using the build tool with the `test` target in the build directory, e.g. `CMAKE_CTEST_PARAMETERS=--output-on-failure make test`.

* `SANITIZE=<instrumentation list>`

  Enables compiler `-fsanitize` instrumentation (e.g. `address,undefined`). The exact options available depend on your compiler and configuration.
